# Cloning Steps

- First clone this repository.
- Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv env` command.
- Activate the virtual environment.
- install packages inside requirements.txt using `pip install -r requirement.txt`
- I got an error while installing PyAudio using pip. I found a solution on stack overflow and used pipwin to install PyAudio `pipwin install PyAudio`. Here is the link https://stackoverflow.com/a/57731053 .
- Run the game using `python main.py`.
